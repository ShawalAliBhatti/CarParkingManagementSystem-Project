# CarParkingManagementSystem-Project
This C++ program efficiently manages a parking lot with limited space for rickshaws, cars, and buses. The system provides a menu-driven interface for users to park vehicles, view records, and delete records. It tracks the total number of parked vehicles, vehicle types, and total earnings, ensuring the capacity does not exceed 50 vehicles.
