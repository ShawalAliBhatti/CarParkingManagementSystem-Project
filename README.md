# Car Parking Management System
This C++ program efficiently manages a parking lot with limited space for rickshaws, cars, and buses. The system provides a menu-driven interface for users to park vehicles, view records, and delete records. It tracks the total number of parked vehicles, vehicle types, and total earnings, ensuring the capacity does not exceed 50 vehicles.
## Features
- Park rickshaws, cars, and buses with corresponding fees.
- View and delete parking records.
- Maintain a maximum capacity of 50 vehicles.
## Implementation
- Developed in C++ with a menu-driven approach.
- Uses loops and conditionals to manage parking logic.
- Tracks vehicle counts and total earnings.
## Usage
Compile and run the source code using a C++ compiler. Follow menu prompts to interact with the system.
